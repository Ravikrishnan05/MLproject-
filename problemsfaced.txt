# Split into training and test sets
user_train, user_test, article_train, article_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    user_features_scaled, 
    article_features_scaled, 
    interaction_scaled.flatten(),  # Flatten for single-dimension target
    train_size=0.8, 
    random_state=42
)

here the 
user_features_scaled has 100 samples.
article_features_scaled has 500 samples.
interaction_scaled.flatten() has 50000 samples.
so 80 percent split didnt happen
